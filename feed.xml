At the time of publication I was not comfortable with adding it to the book, so I cut it. Alas, some have said I should have left it in… so here it is.</p><p>(Available on <a href="https://c1k.it/amat">Apple Books</a> and <a href="https://c1k.it/kmat">Kindle</a>).</p></blockquote><h1 id="postscript-a-personal-reflection">Postscript: A Personal Reflection</h1><p>I have to say, this book has been the hardest one for me to write so far. <em>(Mind you, the future one on personal relationships is the one I’m really dreading!)</em> The reason is pretty simple - how do I explain Autism to a world of HR people when society has gotten Autism all wrong?</p><p>Let me use a metaphor here <em>(and I do this a lot, because it’s often the easiest way to help people understand something)</em>. It’s akin to calling coffee “normal” or “what most people drink.” Now, how do you describe tea? Or juice? Or water? Or the hundreds of other beverages one can have. Sure, there are lots of different coffees and ways to make coffee, but coffee is still coffee, compared to other drinks. So how do you write practical strategies for accommodating minds that could be anything except what we’re used to? Every single Autistic person is different from every other Autistic person. And that’s exactly the problem when companies try to hire Autistic people - most managers don’t understand us, most don’t think like us, and most can’t figure out why we act the way we do or what we need.</p><p>But then I reminded myself - that’s not really what this book is about. This book is about changing how businesses see Autistic people. Not as problems to fix or people to feel sorry for, but as valuable employees who think differently and can help companies do better. And if I stick with the established diagnostic traits only, then I can somewhat generalise some strategies … albeit, in reality, each person, each workplace, each leadership team will need nuanced refinement.</p><p>Writing about Autism today comes with some real challenges that go way beyond just workplace best practices. We’re living in a time when reality TV shows have turned Autism into entertainment. People watch these shows and think they understand what Autism is really like. Add to that the political climate over the past few years - that hasn’t helped either. It’s made some people question whether invisible disabilities are even real.</p><p>What really bothers me is how the media keeps trying to connect Autism with things like Down Syndrome or Williams Syndrome. Head on over to Google Images and search for “Autistic person” … more than half the results show images of people who have these conditions. It’s not because society wants to understand Autism better - It’s because people seem to need to <strong><em>see</em></strong> something different about a person before they’ll believe that person has a disability. Autism is seen as people who cannot function in life, that their disability means they walk around perpetually with noise-cancelling headphones on, that they are non-verbal and prone to “tantrums” … and while ASD Level 3 is truly difficult to support, it makes up smaller fraction of people who have been diagnosed with ASD. This book is not about that though - and even though the full spectrum of Autism deserves more informed attention than it currently gets - this book is about the larger portion of Autistic people who can work, who want to work, but have to navigate systemic thinking that impedes, and in many cases blocks, them from achieving successful working careers. This book is about a corporate society that is too comfortable in normality to understand that not being like others is where innovation is born, where excellence is born, where real advantage over normal-seeking competitors can drive phenomenal success.</p><p>And it’s not only the media misrepresenting Autism - there are also individuals who weaponise it as an excuse for inexcusable behaviour. The executive who mistreats employees and claims it’s their Autism. The public figure who engages in harassment and points to their diagnosis as justification. Autism is a set of observable traits, namely: a) persistent differences in social communication and interaction across contexts; and, b) restricted or repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities. Nowhere in that definition will you find ethics, morality, compassion, or malice - yet those who happen to possess both terrible character and Autism will blame the latter for the former. And the media will lap it up and run with it. I’ve noticed that most of these public bad actors also happen to have brown hair - so should we conclude that all people with brown hair are unethical? It’s ludicrous, yet this correlation-as-causation thinking persists because sensationalism sells, and too many people are buying.</p><p>And then there’s this thing that drives me crazy - people keep saying “everyone is a little Autistic.” I’ve written about this in my other books, Autistic influencers post about it on social media, and it just won’t go away. Even my closest friends have said this to me, even after I’ve explained why it doesn’t make sense. So now I usually ask them: “Close your eyes. What do you see?” They’ll say something like “nothing” or “darkness.” Then I say: “Well, by your thinking, blind people aren’t really disabled because everyone sometimes can’t see things!” I know it sounds harsh, and I don’t mean any disrespect to people with other disabilities. But sometimes you need a strong example to help people understand that invisible disabilities are real. And inevitably they’ll say “that’s not the same thing.” So here’s another example: Crohn’s disease, a debilitating condition of the digestive tract that causes intense and painful spasms and often leads to unexpected bouts of diarrhoea. It’s not a visible disability - but try to sit in a meeting when your digestive tract has its own agenda. Everyone has diarrhoea now and then - so it can’t be a disability, right? What makes a condition a disability is that it significantly impacts a person’s ability to function and requires meaningful support for that person to live a humane life. Autism is a disability - it’s included in many countries’ laws under their disability legislation. And yes, Autism is a set of diagnostic traits that many, if not most people may have - but what makes ASD “real” is that Autistic people need to navigate those traits every waking moment of their lives.</p><p>But here’s what most people don’t grasp about what makes Autism a disability: it’s not the traits themselves that disable us - it’s the world’s refusal to accept different ways of being. An Autistic person who processes information differently, who communicates directly rather than through layers of social convention, who finds comfort in routine and logic - none of these things are inherently disabling. What disables us is working in environments designed exclusively for neurotypical minds, being judged as “difficult” or “unprofessional” for communicating honestly, facing rejection for not performing the elaborate social theatre that everyone else seems to know the script for. The disability isn’t in our neurology - it’s in a society that mistakes difference for deficiency and conformity for competence - and the ostracisation that comes with that. We’re disabled by exclusion, by assumptions, by workplaces that could accommodate us but choose not to because “that’s not how we do things here.” That’s what makes Autism a disability in the legal sense - not because we’re broken, but because the world around us refuses to make room for minds that work differently.</p><p>I’ve often seen the explanation of a disability as a graphic where 3 people are standing by a fence trying to look over it. The first person is a lot shorter than the fence. The second is just as tall as the fence. And the third person is taller than the fence. This graphic is often used to describe that disability support is not about equality in resources, but rather <strong><em>equity</em></strong> in outcomes. That supporting the shorter person will need two boxes to get them as tall as the third, and the second person only needs one box to stand on. This anecdotal explanation tries to show that support varies depending on the severity of the disability. And this leads me to the second thing that really gets me angry - when people say things like “you’ll just have to mask more” or “can’t you just try harder to fit in?” or “everyone has to adapt at work.” This is akin to asking that short person in the fence graphic to jump up and down more so that they can see over the fence. And you know what? They can, and I bet they do - the alternative is to just give up, right? One would not dare say to a wheelchair-bound person that they can just leopard crawl up the stairs, because they <em>can</em> do that. So why is it okay to ask an Autistic person to mask more when the act of masking is what causes their burnout, anxiety, mental health impacts, identity confusion, and eventual loss of authenticity? And therein lies the problem … we <em>can</em>, and we <em>do</em>, but what if we didn’t have to? What if we just got the right support, or our hurdles removed, so that we can have an equitable and just existence as other people do? What if, instead of expecting us to exhaust ourselves jumping - or in many cases, we simply give up - someone just gave us the box we need to stand on? Or better yet, what if we just tore down the barriers that shouldn’t be there to begin with?</p><p>The other societal habit I have a distinct distaste for is speaking about Autism as something on a simple scale. Terms like “high functioning” or “severe” Autism suggest a measurable ranking of people, but that view is superficial and fundamentally flawed.</p><p>Consider two people. The first was diagnosed early in childhood with more pronounced traits but received proper support and coping strategies from the beginning. The second had less apparent traits initially, so they went undiagnosed. Perhaps they lived a privileged life where circumstances naturally accommodated them, or perhaps they simply masked brilliantly. Then one day, something changes - a new job, a relationship breakdown, a pandemic, burnout. What worked before suddenly doesn’t, and their life collapses around them. Many never even discover why. Who is “higher functioning” here? The person with stronger traits who learned to navigate them, or the person with milder traits whose life fell apart? The question itself reveals how meaningless these labels are.</p><p>And here’s what those reality TV shows and dismissive politicians consistently miss: Autism rarely exists in isolation. Many Autistic people also have ADHD, anxiety disorders, dyslexia, or other conditions. Humans aren’t singular, neat categories. Saying someone is “just Autistic” is like saying a person has a left hand and therefore they are a left hand, full stop - as if the right hand, the legs, the brain, the heart don’t exist or matter. Yet this reductive thinking persists.</p><p>Even the diagnostic frameworks can’t agree on how to classify Autism. The US system uses three levels based on support needs. The European approach classifies people by cognitive and language abilities instead. If psychology itself hasn’t found a consistent way to categorise us, perhaps that should tell us something: Autism isn’t a ranking system of who’s “better” or “worse.” It’s just part of what a person is - one aspect of their humanity, not a measure of their worth or capability.</p><p>So why write this book at all when there’s so much misunderstanding to fight against? Because despite all the confusion out there, some companies are figuring out that when they support neurodivergent employees properly, those employees become some of their best workers. These companies aren’t doing charity work - they’re making smart business decisions. This book comes out of frustration, yes, but also out of hope.</p><div style="text-align:center">&#8258;</div><p></p><p>These pages aren’t about feeling sorry for Autistic people or doing the <em>“right thing”</em> just to be nice. They’re about making your business better. When you stop valuing people primarily for their social conformity and start valuing them for their productive contributions, when you stop seeing Autism as a list of problems and start seeing it as a different way of thinking that can help your company, that’s when real change happens.</p><p>If you’ve read this far, you’re probably already someone who cares about doing better. And whether you realise it or not, you likely have something many Autistic people don’t: the privilege of social advantage. Perhaps you’re a hiring manager who finds networking effortless, a leader whose communication style naturally aligns with corporate norms, an HR professional who instinctively navigates office politics, or someone with connections in other companies. That’s not a criticism - it’s an acknowledgment of reality. But with that privilege comes an opportunity, and frankly, a responsibility.</p><p>Help us. Use that privilege to hire the candidate who interviews awkwardly but has brilliant ideas. Use that influence to challenge the manager who dismisses someone as “not a culture fit” simply because they’re different. Talk to your connections in other companies about this book - recommend it. Better yet, speak to those connections about considering neurodivergent talent that their recruitment processes are currently blocking. Champion the Autistic employee who delivers exceptional work but struggles in open-plan offices. Push back when colleagues mistake directness for rudeness or routine for rigidity.</p><p>Start small if you need to. Implement even one strategy from this book. Question one assumption about what “professional” behaviour must look like. Defend one Autistic employee from criticism that’s really just coded language for “doesn’t conform.” Create one policy that values output over social performance. That’s how systemic change begins - not with grand gestures, but with people who have advantage choosing to use it to dismantle barriers rather than reinforce them.</p><p>We’re not asking for charity or sympathy. We’re asking you to recognise that innovation, excellence, and competitive advantage don’t come from everyone thinking the same way - they come from making room for minds that work differently. The way things have always been done isn’t the only way, and it’s often not even the best way.</p><p>Help us. Because we can’t do this alone.</p><div style="text-align:center">&#8258;</div><p></p>]]></content><author><name>Silvino Rodrigues</name></author><category term="ASD," /><category term="Autism," /><category term="Book" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The following is the unpublished Postscript from the Book Modernising HR for Variant Minds: Autism - The Monotropic Mind.

He never joined the small talk before meetings, didn’t come to Friday drinks, and I assumed he wasn’t a team player. Then one morning we had a system outage. While everyone else was scrambling, Ethan quietly opened a log file, found the fault, and fixed it before IT arrived. He’d been tracking tiny inconsistencies for weeks - just because they didn’t “look right.” That was the day I realised he wasn’t disengaged. He was hyper-engaged, just differently. I’d been managing through assumptions, not understanding.”</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="autism-in-a-cubicle">Autism in a cubicle</h2><p>Most people think they know what autism is, yet few understand how it actually operates in day-to-day working life. For many managers, “autism” still conjures images of savants, social awkwardness, or someone who “doesn’t make eye contact.” In truth, autism is a distinctive cognitive and sensory profile - not a malfunction, but a different operating system. It values depth over breadth, truth over convention, and structure over spontaneity.</p><p>Autistic people are not detached from the world; they are often deeply tuned in - just not always to the same signals their neurotypical colleagues notice. What looks like avoidance is usually sensory overload. What seems like obsession is often passion. What appears blunt is usually clarity. The problem is not the person; it is that workplaces have been built for multitasking, socially driven minds, rewarding the behaviours those minds find effortless. Autism doesn’t break those systems - it exposes where they were never as fair or efficient as we assumed.</p><p>In clinical classification systems such as the <em>DSM-5-TR</em><sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and the <em>ICD-11</em><sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is defined as a neurodevelopmental condition characterised by:</p><ul><li>Persistent differences in social communication and interaction across contexts; and</li><li>Restricted or repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities.</li></ul><p>It is worth noting, however, that while both systems describe the same condition, their purposes diverge. The DSM-5 serves a clinical function - assigning one of three “support levels” based on how much assistance a person may need. These levels (1: requiring support, 2: substantial support, and 3: very substantial support) can change over time as they depend heavily on the person’s environment. The ICD-11, by contrast, categorises autism through a matrix model, using two primary axes: impairment of functional language and presence or absence of intellectual disability.</p><p>But that is the clinical view - and it tells us almost nothing about the lived reality of autistic adults in the workplace. These classifications matter for diagnosis and support access, but they tell managers almost nothing about daily collaboration. At its core, autism reflects a brain that is wired differently from the statistical majority - what society calls “normal.” Pause for a moment and consider what that means. There are billions of potential neurological variations within that definition. And therein lies the complexity: autism cannot define a person as a fixed set of traits or behaviours. Each individual presents differently.</p><p>Decades of study have identified clusters of common - though not universal - features. Some autistic people prefer quiet spaces or minimal social interaction. Others thrive on structure and find comfort in sorting, categorising, or repeating patterns. Some display physical movements, such as hand-flapping when excited. Others talk a great deal, often about specific topics like trains or data systems, and may struggle to “read the room” or avoid interrupting. And then there are those who appear entirely “typical” but are expending enormous energy masking - consciously suppressing their natural behaviours to appear socially conventional. These employees often return home so exhausted from the effort of “acting normal” that they cannot fully engage with family or friends. Imagine performing social theatre every day, knowing the wrong gesture could be misread as disinterest or defiance.</p><p>All these are expressions of what we call the Autism Spectrum. It is not a scale from “low” to “high,” nor a ladder from Level 1 to 3. It is more like a lake of difference - wide, deep, and varied. One person may struggle with noise but excel at visual patterns; another may shut down in crowds yet find joy in precision and order. Autism isn’t about how autistic someone is - it’s about how autism shows up. Each person different. Each experience unique.</p><h2 id="when-different-is-different-enough">When “different” is different enough</h2><p>It’s fair to ask: if everyone is different, what makes one person’s difference Autism and another’s simply personality? After all, most workplaces already celebrate individuality, creativity, and “thinking outside the box.”</p><p>The answer lies in how deep and consistent the differences run. Autism isn’t a collection of quirks or preferences; it’s a stable neurological architecture that shapes how someone perceives, filters, and responds to the world. These aren’t situational traits - they’re built into how the brain connects and communicates.</p><p>For neurotypical people, social, sensory, and cognitive differences fluctuate depending on mood, environment, or experience. For autistic people, those differences are constant and structural. The wiring itself channels attention, perception, and communication along distinct pathways. It’s not about a degree of difference, but a kind of difference.</p><p>Autistic brains process information through networks that favour precision, pattern recognition, and depth of focus, sometimes at the expense of rapid social inference or effortless multitasking <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Social meaning, for example, is decoded through logic rather than intuition. The brain doesn’t “fill in the blanks” of implied communication - it needs the blanks filled in. Likewise, sensory systems register stimuli that others might not even notice, turning what seems like mild background noise into an avalanche of competing data.</p><p>The result is a predictable pattern across multiple life domains:</p><ul><li>Communication and interaction follow clear, literal logic.</li><li>Sensory input is processed more intensely or unevenly.</li><li>Attention flows in single, deep channels rather than dispersed multitasking.</li><li>Transitions and unpredictability impose heavier executive-function loads.</li></ul><p>This consistency is what distinguishes autism from ordinary variation. Everyone occasionally misses a cue, seeks quiet, or focuses deeply. Autistic people experience those differences as the baseline - not the exception. They move through the world interpreting information on a different frequency, and that frequency remains constant regardless of circumstance.</p><p>Dr Lorna Wing described it <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> simply: <em>“It’s not that autistic people have special features; it’s that their whole perception of reality is organised differently.”</em></p><p>That’s why autism is not a set of “traits” that a person happens to have, but a distinct cognitive lens - one that influences how reality itself is experienced. When that difference intersects with environments designed for another lens, challenges appear. But the difference itself is neither wrong nor inferior. It is, quite literally, another way of being human.</p><h2 id="a-brief-detour-how-we-learned-to-misunderstand-autism">A brief detour: how we learned to misunderstand Autism</h2><p>For decades, autism was interpreted almost entirely through a medical or deficit lens. Early research in the mid-twentieth century viewed autistic traits as symptoms to be eliminated rather than patterns to be understood. Even as diagnostic frameworks improved, popular culture reinforced stereotypes of emotionless logic, child-like helplessness, or detached intellect. Those narratives quietly seeped into organisational life.</p><p>But the misunderstanding runs deeper than clinical history. Over the last century, social science itself codified social behaviour into moral behaviour. Traits that made people comfortable were labelled “good,” and those that didn’t were labelled “bad.” Eye contact became shorthand for honesty; a firm handshake signified confidence; smiling at the right moments suggested warmth and cooperation; interrupting seen as arrogance; quietness mistaken for disengagement.</p><p>These moralised interpretations of social behaviour - born from neurotypical majority norms - still dominate workplaces today. They appear in performance reviews (“lacks interpersonal warmth”), hiring rubrics (“strong eye contact”), and leadership training (“commanding presence”). None of these have anything to do with skill, integrity, or competence - but everything to do with conformity to a particular social rhythm.</p><p>Autistic communication simply runs on a different rhythm. Many autistic people process social signals literally, rely on direct language, and prefer depth over small talk. Their facial expressions, tone, or gestures may not align with expected conventions, but that has no bearing on their honesty, intent, or empathy. As psychologist Damian Milton <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> observed in his Double Empathy theory, communication breakdowns between autistic and non-autistic people are bi-directional misunderstandings, not deficits on one side.</p><p>HR systems inherited both these medical and moral assumptions: framing autism as a set of deficits to fix and deviations to manage. The language followed suit: “high-functioning”, “low-functioning”, “disorder”, and “abnormal”. Each term subtly locates the “problem” inside the person rather than within the environment. The modern neurodiversity paradigm reverses that logic. It recognises autism as one natural variation of human cognition and argues that social and workplace barriers - not autistic traits - create disadvantage <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.</p><p>This shift matters. Workplaces are still catching up. Many diversity frameworks remain trapped in the “medical–moral” hybrid - expecting individuals to adapt, then rewarding those who best mimic the majority. True inclusion begins when organisations stop reading difference as defiance and start recognising that social fluency is not the same as moral character.</p><p>Policies built on pathology focus on accommodation after the fact, rather than designing systems that work for everyone from the start. Understanding autism through this updated lens reframes inclusion from charity to competence: a matter of design, not diagnosis.</p><h2 id="a-business-case-for-those-who-dont-think-they-care">A business case (for those who don’t think they care)</h2><p>Even leaders unmoved by moral or social arguments should pay attention to the economics. Across developed economies, between 60 and 80 per cent of autistic adults remain unemployed or under-employed - an extraordinary waste of skill and investment <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. This gap represents lost productivity, higher turnover, and billions in unused talent every year. Yet where organisations build the right conditions, autistic employees consistently show greater accuracy, reliability, and ethical integrity than their peers <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.</p><p>Inclusion is often framed through the language of law - the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990), the UK Equality Act (2010), the Canadian Human Rights Act (1985), and the Australian Disability Discrimination Act (1992). These frameworks are essential, but they are also reactive: they protect rights after someone has already been excluded or harmed. In practice, this means most corporate risk systems treat disability inclusion as a compliance safeguard, not as a strategic design principle.</p><p>That mindset creates a quiet paradox. When companies see disability as a potential legal exposure, they may unconsciously avoid hiring people they fear they’ll later have to “accommodate.” It’s not malicious - it’s risk aversion disguised as neutrality. But it’s also how opportunity is lost before talent ever reaches the interview.</p><p>The real advantage comes when inclusion is built upstream, before recruitment even begins. When hiring systems, job descriptions, and performance criteria are designed with neurodiversity in mind, compliance becomes almost irrelevant - because the environment itself no longer discriminates. This is the essence of universal design in HR: make systems functional for all minds, and the need for accommodation largely disappears.</p><p>Diverse cognitive teams outperform homogeneous ones because they approach problems differently. They notice the blind spots others miss, identify errors earlier, and challenge assumptions that would otherwise go untested. According to Deloitte’s Human Capital Trends analysis <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>, cognitive diversity can lift problem-solving performance by up to 20% and risk detection by nearly 30%.</p><p>For HR leaders focused on productivity, retention, and innovation, inclusion is not about avoiding lawsuits or managing liabilities. It’s about future-proofing the organisation itself - guarding against the risk of sameness, missed opportunity, and stagnant thinking. In that sense, inclusion is less a moral gesture and more a resilience strategy: it strengthens the business by expanding how it thinks, reacts, and adapts.</p><h2 id="autism-as-a-different-way-of-processing-information">Autism as a different way of processing information</h2><p>Autism isn’t defined by a single feature or deficit. It is a constellation of interconnected differences in how people perceive, filter, and act on information. These differences don’t reflect intelligence or motivation - they reflect a distinct way of organising experience.</p><p>For autistic people, those filters work differently. Research in sensory neuroscience shows that autistic brains assign unusually high precision to incoming data - sights, sounds, words, and even internal thoughts - meaning that information arrives with roughly equal importance instead of being automatically prioritised <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref:35:1"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. What others’ brains dampen as background noise remains present, demanding conscious effort to sort and interpret. That extra filtering step consumes mental energy, which is why seemingly simple tasks - like following a meeting conversation in a noisy room - can be exhausting. It’s not distraction; it’s data overload.</p><p>Different theoretical frameworks attempt to explain these cognitive patterns. Frith and Happé’s weak central coherence theory <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> suggests autistic people naturally focus on details rather than gestalt wholes. Others, like enhanced perceptual functioning theory <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>, emphasise superior discrimination of sensory information. More recent predictive processing <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref:39:1"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> accounts explore differences in how autistic brains generate and update expectations about the world. Each framework illuminates particular aspects of autistic cognition without fully capturing its complexity. For workplace purposes, one especially practical lens is <strong>monotropism</strong>, which describes autistic cognition as tending toward narrow, deep streams of attention rather than spreading focus broadly across multiple inputs <sup id="fnref:34:1"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. This does not define autism, but it helps explain the familiar pattern of intense concentration, difficulty switching tasks, and strong preference for clarity that many autistic people report.</p><p>This attentional style can be an extraordinary advantage when work aligns with interest. It fuels the kind of sustained concentration behind breakthrough research, flawless code, and process excellence. When interest meets purpose, the autistic brain enters what Mihály Csíkszentmihályi called flow <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> - a state of deep focus that can last hours without fatigue.</p><p>However, in environments that demand constant context switching or social multitasking, that same strength becomes a liability. Every interruption, ambiguous instruction, or “quick chat” triggers an expensive mental reorientation. Think of it like shifting a microscope lens mid-focus: each time the field changes, the entire system must recalibrate before clarity returns. Over a full workday, those micro-switches accumulate into what psychologists call executive-function load - the hidden cognitive tax of unpredictability.</p><p>Understanding this cost helps HR stop pathologising behaviour and start adjusting structure. The employee who resists “ad hoc meetings” may not be inflexible; they may be protecting their processing bandwidth. The person who prefers written instructions isn’t avoiding collaboration; they’re minimising ambiguity to stay accurate. Once these patterns are recognised as neurological, not attitudinal, productivity strategies shift from fixing people to fixing friction.</p><p>The idea of the spectrum is also widely misunderstood. Autism is not a straight line from “mild” to “severe.” It is more accurately a multidimensional profile - a pattern of traits that vary in intensity across domains such as communication, sensory experience, and attention amongst others. The specific mix, not the “level,” defines the individual.</p><p>To borrow an image: imagine a lake with countless depths and currents. Each autistic person moves through that water differently. Some need calm surfaces and predictable routines to stay afloat. Others dive deep into their interests and surface with insights no one else imagined. Some are driven by rules, others by creativity; many by both. The water isn’t shallow or deep - it’s simply varied. Autism isn’t about how autistic someone is; it’s about how autism shows up in their particular current.</p><p>For HR, understanding that variability is crucial. It reminds us that no policy, job description, or accommodation will fit everyone. The goal is not uniformity, but design elasticity - systems flexible enough to meet employees where their cognition naturally flows.</p><h2 id="communication-and-the-double-empathy-problem">Communication and the double empathy problem</h2><p>Modern communication theory, from Carl Rogers’ humanistic psychology <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> to symbolic interactionism <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>, has long posited that empathy is the foundation of mutual understanding. Empathy enables people to infer others’ intentions, predict reactions, and maintain social harmony - what Rogers described as a “necessary and sufficient condition” for genuine connection. But these theories were developed through neurotypical lenses. They assume that empathy operates in predictable ways.</p><p>Social communication differences - one of the two diagnostic domains of autism <sup id="fnref:31:1"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> - are among the most frequent fault lines in workplace misunderstanding. Autistic people often prioritise accuracy over tone. A manager’s “constructive feedback” may sound vague or contradictory; an autistic employee’s directness may be mistaken for rudeness.</p><p>Psychologist Damian Milton <sup id="fnref:15:1"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> proposed that these breakdowns aren’t caused by a lack of empathy, but by a mismatch in how empathy works between autistic and non-autistic people - a theory he called the Double Empathy Problem.</p><p>In traditional psychology, empathy may be described with two different meanings. Cognitive empathy is the ability to infer what someone else is thinking or intending. While emotional empathy, is the ability to feel and respond to another’s emotions. In simpler terms, cognitive empathy is when I understand how you feel, and emotional empathy is when I literally feel what you feel.</p><p>Research suggests that autistic people generally show typical or even heightened emotional empathy - they feel deeply, often to the point of overwhelm - but may struggle with cognitive empathy when social cues are subtle or inconsistent <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. Non-autistic people, conversely, tend to rely heavily on shared social conventions and can misread autistic communication because it follows a different logic and rhythm.</p><p>In other words, both sides experience empathy - just differently. The autistic person may miss a hint, while the neurotypical person misses sincerity. Each interprets the other through their own social code, and both can leave the exchange feeling unseen or disrespected.</p><p>Milton’s research, later expanded by Crompton and colleagues <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>, shows that autistic-to-autistic communication is often fluent, intuitive, and mutually satisfying, while mixed-neurotype exchanges are more likely to falter. The lesson for HR is profound: communication breakdowns arise not because one party lacks empathy, but because both are operating from different empathic frameworks.</p><p>Once managers grasp this, they stop confusing clarity with conflict and begin recognising that “poor communication” may simply mean mismatched translation. Building systems that favour explicit, written, and predictable interaction closes that gap - not by asking one side to adapt more, but by levelling the interpretive field for both.</p><h2 id="bridging-forward-from-understanding-to-design">Bridging forward: from understanding to design</h2><p>So when we talk about autism at work, we are not describing deficits in people but mismatches between minds and systems. The differences we’ve explored - in perception, attention, and communication - only become problems when the workplace demands conformity to a single cognitive style.</p><p>The next chapter turns from definition to impact. It examines what happens when organisations fail to recognise these mismatches - the hidden costs of exclusion, burnout, and lost innovation - and why inclusion is not simply a moral gesture but a business imperative. By understanding the price of inaccessibility, we can begin designing workplaces that value difference as an asset rather than treating it as an exception.</p><p style="text-align:center">⁂</p><hr /><div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"><ol><li id="fn:31"><p>APS.

The rest of this chapter explains why.</p><h2 id="adhd-in-ten-sentences">ADHD in ten sentences</h2><p>The heart of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a dysregulation of the brain’s dopamine system - a key driver of interneuron communication and a major influence on the reward-and-priority circuitry of the wider prefrontal networks. When this critical brain function does not operate normally, the outcome can vary from difficulty initiating tasks to bursts of concentrated attention, often called hyperfocus. That’s why an ADHD person can overlook a simple compliance-form deadline yet map a complex network failure at 3 a.m. in microscopic detail. In other words, variable attention is a downstream symptom, not the root cause. These variant brain functions often lead to what is perceived as attention swings, and is often mistaken for bad character or laziness <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><p>That neurological variability isn’t rare; in adults the global diagnosed prevalence hovers around 2.5% <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, while the symptomatic screening scale indicate ≈6-7%, meaning that about three in every hundred employees to have ADHD that meets full clinical criteria, or, if you include undiagnosed and sub-threshold cases, the pool can rise to one in fifteen - so odds are there’s someone on your floor right now who doesn’t yet know they have ADHD traits.</p><p>Although diagnostic manuals list three presentations - mostly inattentive, mostly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined - real-world expression is a messy spectrum. Many ADHD people, particularly women and groups who were culturally marginalised, were missed as children because their symptoms resembled day-dreaming, inner restlessness, or perfect note-taking that covered the turmoil beneath <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.

A graduate program supervisor praises “crisis wizardry” yet files “needs to plan ahead” on the same review.

Executive-function load climbs; masking the struggle drains energy, anxiety creeps in. Without systemic scaffolds Sam risks burnout even while colleagues perceive “high potential”.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Think of dopamine as the brain’s project-manager-plus-barista: it gives priority <em>and</em> provides the jolt of inspiration to get going. In ADHD circuitry, delivery service is erratic - sometimes early, sometimes non-existent and sometimes in excess and sometimes in deficit. Routine chores (expenses, required e-learning, monthly measurements) present with no dopamine attached, so they slide down the mental escalator. On the other hand, high-novelty or high-stakes assignments or problem solving cause a flood that sets off a turbo-charged sprint at 3 a.m. the night before board papers are due.</p><p>Neuroscience shows dopamine has two different rhythms. <strong>Phasic bursts</strong> are the sudden, sharp waves that occur when something suddenly matters, while <strong>tonic firing</strong> is the slow, background drip that keeps attention in neutral <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. In ADHD phasic spikes occur later and shoot higher than usual, while the tonic baseline is lower than usual <sup id="fnref:25:2"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Imagine a harbour during spring tide, when the water rushes in and floods the pier after pulling back so far that you can see the sandbars. Routine e-learning, monthly metrics, and expense forms are like wading through mud at low tide. New client fire drills, hack-day prototypes, and unexpected pattern recognition are all examples of high tide.</p><table class="offset"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src="/assets/img/insights/2025/lightbulb-32x32.svg" alt="" /></td><td><strong>Insight:</strong><em>Why it matters for HR</em><br /><br /><em>Workplace design must happen at low tide.</em> Calendars, checkpoints and feedback scripts get locked in while the water is calm, because that is when the employee most needs the external map. <em>Performance can peak at high tide.</em> Those same phasic surges drive hyperfocus, crisis composure and idea generation. In other words, the condition’s greatest management liability and its sharpest competitive edge are two faces of the same tidal cycle. <br /><br /> A longitudinal study of stimulant-treated adults found that when projects supplied clear schedules and visible progress cues, baseline (tonic-state) productivity rose by 27% - and the phasic highs still delivered 40% faster bug-resolution times than non-ADHD peers <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.

The tidal rhythm becomes an asset, not a risk.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Interestingly, emotional regulation rides the same neuro-circuit that governs the tidal swing of dopamine, which is why Sam’s cheeks can flush crimson at either praise or critique. The reaction often puzzles managers: you thank Sam for “saving the day,” Sam shrugs it off as “just doing my job,” yet one hour later a mild note about font size feels like a gut-punch. This paradox is best understood through Rejection-Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD), a form of neurologically amplified social pain reported by many ADHD adults <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. Because ADHD heightens threat detection, the brain flags possible rejection as urgent, giving negative cues priority access to attention and memory while letting positive cues slide by almost unnoticed <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. A passing remark you meant as routine coaching can hit Sam like a red-alert siren. Instead of leaving a gap that might fester, give the context and the core message up front and in writing - but stay in the room (or on the call). A short note that states the purpose (“Two quick tweaks to tighten the slide deck, add clout to the pitch; goal is client-ready by 4 p.m.”) lets Sam read the exact words, check for hidden landmines, and ask clarifying questions on the spot. Seeing the text anchors working memory; hearing your steady tone signals the sky isn’t falling. Follow with one specific success, one concrete improvement, and agree on the very next action. The brain now has a roadmap, not a riddle, so the threat response winds down, and the cognitive engine can engage.</p><table class="offset"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src="/assets/img/insights/2025/thumbtack-32x32.svg" alt="" /></td><td><strong>Manager cue:</strong><br /> Safety first, then standards. Put the feedback in a brief written stub, share your screen or slide it across the table, then walk through it together. The clarity quells rumination; collaboration turns potential rejection into joint problem-solving - not judge and defendant. The emotional load drops; the cognitive engine switches on.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="signature-challenges-in-the-workplace">Signature challenges in the workplace</h2><p>Time blindness is the headline act. Ask an ADHD employee for an estimate and you may receive optimism untethered to arithmetic. It is not dishonesty; the temporal self-monitor of the brain is simply missing batteries <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. Combine that with executive-function gridlock - difficulties starting, sequencing and switching tasks - and the typical corporate day becomes an obstacle course.</p><p>Meetings layer on another hazard: working-memory deficits. Even if Sam can remember every specification of the client’s software stack from three years ago, he may forget point 1 by the time you reach point 4 when agenda items fly in fast succession. Add an open-plan office with fluorescent lighting, and you have a live sensory distraction demonstration.</p><p>The perplexing lag between knowing and doing is known as “initiation inertia.” Sam can visualise every step - open the spreadsheet, pull the data from the previous month, and drop it into the dashboard - but he simply won’t get started. Neuroimaging research indicates that the stall starts when low-tonic dopamine is unable to provide the slight surge of perceived importance that typically initiates action <sup id="fnref:25:3"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The prefrontal cortex hesitates in the absence of a chemical “go” signal, and two types of drag simultaneously take over. First comes decision paralysis, where the task feels more difficult than it actually is because every micro-choice (which tab, which field, which font) vies for limited executive bandwidth <sup id="fnref:2:1"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. Optimal Arousal Theory is the basis for the second strategic delay. Sam’s brain knows that a phasic dopamine surge will make the work nearly effortless once the deadline approaches, so starting early feels inefficient. After all, why push mud uphill now when a tide will lift it later <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>? Deeper down, however, a more subtle motivation may be concealed: the worry that if you finish too soon, you’ll have a period of under-stimulating time, which many ADHD sufferers find more punishing than the task itself <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> - ADHD individuals literally fear boredom. The outcome is an odd combination of involuntary procrastination and paralysis, neither of which gives way to a quick “just get started.” An external spark - an accountability check-in, a visible countdown clock, a coworker working concurrently- breaks the impasse until the brain’s natural chemistry catches up.</p><p>Ignored, these conflict areas lead to performance-review heartache, presenteeism, or quiet quitting masquerading as tiredness <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>.</p><table class="box"><thead><tr><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong class="h3">Optimal Arousal Theory</strong><br /><br /> … was developed long before ADHD was listed in diagnostic manuals. Its origins date back to 1908, when American psychologists Robert Yerkes and John Dodson demonstrated that mice learned a task most quickly at a middle-range stimulus intensity level: too little stimulation resulted in slow learning, while too much caused disarray <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. Donald Hebb expanded the concept to humans half a century later, suggesting that the brain looks for a “just-right” zone of cortical arousal and will take conscious or unconscious action to bring it back whenever it deviates <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. <br /><br /> In the 1970s, Hebb’s thread was picked up by researchers looking into children’s hyperactivity. Susan Zentall’s classroom experiments found that children who were later recognised as ADHD performed better on academic tasks when they were allowed to move around or listen to background noise, and worse when they were made to sit still and silent. She explicitly framed this pattern in terms of Optimal Arousal <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. These behavioural findings were linked to dopamine-driven fluctuations in the brain’s alerting networks by later neurobiological research, such as Edmund Sonuga-Barke’s dual-pathway theory and Emmanuel Sergeant’s state-regulation model <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. <br /><br /> Put simply, the theory says that each brain has a preferred stimulation bandwidth. In its tonic state, an ADHD brain sits lower than the majority of neurotypical brains, which automatically hover there, i.e. ADHD brains are, in their unaroused mode, dysfunctional. Thus, it unconsciously looks for additional input - fidgeting, novelty-hunting, crisis-chasing - to enter the “Goldilocks” zone until phasic dopamine surges provide sufficient arousal. Following the discovery of this connection to dopamine timing, the Optimal Arousal Theory emerged as a key lens through which to explain why ADHD behaviour fluctuates between under-engagement and laser-like intensity and why managers can effectively use external structure instead of self-discipline lectures. This is also why off-the-shelf personality inventories often misclassify ADHD potential, but more of that in Chapter 4.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="unequalled-advantages-when-conditions-are-right">Unequalled advantages (when conditions are right)</h2><p>Flip the script, and those same neurological traits power serious competitive edge. Hyperfocus is the proverbial super-laser on bleeding-edge puzzles: cybersecurity incident rooms, forensic audits, emergency logistics, late-stage product bugs, critical event management. Hyperfocus weapons-grade problem-solving.

Alex previously sent out an email with a Friday night deadline; this time, Alex makes calendar invites for micro-milestones: draft by Wednesday at 17:00, outline by Tuesday at 14:00, and polish window on Thursday night. Six and two hours prior to each checkpoint, Slack reminders automatically go off.<br /><br /><strong>Tuesday:</strong> The time-boxed block transforms an abstract goal into an instantaneous cue when Sam opens the outline invite. Sam’s card slides to “in progress” on the team wall, which eliminates the need for everyone, including Sam, to keep track of who is on what.<br /><br /><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Open-plan noise spikes on Wednesdays. Sam turns on his firm-supplied, permission-implied-by-policy noise-cancelling headphones. The draft lands at 16:48 and slides to “awaiting review” on the board, preventing derailment thanks to the sensory toggle. <br /><br /><strong>Thursday:</strong> QA feedback is disseminated. Revisions conclude within the allotted polishing block, and Sam’s rejection-sensitive dysphoria remains silent because feedback follows a script: one positive note, one actionable correction if needed. No one works past 19:00, and the team turns over to Marketing on time.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Sam didn’t have to download any additional apps or summon hidden will-power at any point. The heavy lifting was done by shared scaffolds, which included external memory, visible time, sensory control, and clear feedback.</p><h2 id="what-else-might-show-up">What else might show up?</h2><p>Rarely does ADHD show up alone. According to a dimensional analysis of 60 studies, roughly six in ten ADHD adults fit full criteria for an anxiety disorder and roughly one-third for a depressive disorder <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. Medication and counselling can reduce impairment scores; in workplaces that demand constant self-camouflage, that progress collapses. Employees pour energy into “looking normal” instead of performing their jobs. The resulting cognitive fatigue drags symptoms back to baseline.</p><p>Diagnostic blind-spots magnify that risk. Women and gender-diverse ADHD people are routinely identified years later than men, in part because inattentive or internalising profiles violate the cultural stereotype of the disruptive boy in the classroom; long-form reviews report delays of five-plus years and higher rates of misdiagnosed anxiety or mood disorder <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>. Race and ethnicity add another layer: a ten-year cohort study of more than five million Kaiser Permanente members showed that Asian, Black and Hispanic adults were 20-40% less likely than White peers to receive an ADHD code even when symptom counts and impairment levels matched <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>. Under-recognition means those employees enter HR processes without a label, but not without the executive-function load.</p><p>And one of the most dangerous outcomes of all this misinterpretation is when chronic under-stimulation begins to resemble clinical depression, particularly for workers whose ADHD tends to be quiet or internal.</p><table class="offset"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src="/assets/img/insights/2025/lightbulb-32x32.svg" alt="" /></td><td><strong>Insight:</strong> For ADHD minds, boredom isn’t trivial - <i>it’s dangerous</i>. Extended periods of low stimulation can trigger an emotional state that mimics clinical depression: fatigue, hopelessness, disinterest, even suicidal ideation. And too often, this state is misdiagnosed, leading to treatment plans that miss the root cause: dopamine starvation. This is not a failure of resilience; it’s a neurological consequence of how <em>lifelong</em> brain function shapes experience for these individuals. Environments that fail to engage the ADHD brain aren’t just unproductive (underutilising a brain that can do more) - they’re mentally hazardous.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The implication is clear for HR. First, create universal-design practices - clear written agendas, shared task boards, quiet-focus options - that any employee can use without declaring a diagnosis.

Pulling an all-nighter proves Sam has plenty of grit, and the slides in both versions of the tale were equally polished. What changed was the runway the manager built. Sam’s invisible, last-minute deadline let time work against him in the first scenario, thus the outcome appeared to be flakiness and inadequate cooperation. The visible checkpoints in the second scenario handled timekeeping and let everyone see consistent development. Without a performance plan, a pep-talk, or a single extra dollar of budget, the manager turned the same employee from “high-maintenance” to “high-value” by moving the emphasis from personal virtue to shared structure.</p><p style="text-align:center">&#x2042;</p><h2 id="reality-check">Reality check</h2><p>ADHD is not a passing phase or a motivational flaw - it is a lifetime variation in how the dopamine system of the brain pulses and times its signals <sup id="fnref:25:4"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Routine tasks never seem urgent when that timing runs late; when it surges, the same brain can lock into hyperfocus and map a complex problem at lightning speed.

There is evidence of significant inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms prior to age 12, typically by early to mid-childhood, though some individuals may first come to clinical attention later. The degree of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity is outside the limits of normal variation expected for age and level of intellectual functioning. Inattention refers to significant difficulty in sustaining attention to tasks that do not provide a high level of stimulation or frequent rewards, distractibility and problems with organisation. Hyperactivity refers to excessive motor activity and difficulties with remaining still, most evident in structured situations that require behavioural self-control. Impulsivity is a tendency to act in response to immediate stimuli, without deliberation or consideration of the risks and consequences. The relative balance and the specific manifestations of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive characteristics varies across individuals and may change over the course of development. In order for a diagnosis to be made, manifestations of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity must be evident across multiple situations or settings (e.g., home, school, work, with friends or relatives), but are likely to vary according to the structure and demands of the setting. Symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural, or neurodevelopmental disorder and are not due to the effect of a substance or medication.</p><h2 id="diagnostic-requirements">Diagnostic Requirements</h2><h3 id="essential-required-features">Essential (Required) Features:</h3><ul><li>A persistent pattern (e.g., at least 6 months) of inattention symptoms and/or a combination of hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms that is outside the limits of normal variation expected for age and level of intellectual development.

In many cases, hyperactivity symptoms predominate in preschool and decrease with age such that they are no longer prominent beyond adolescence or may instead be reported as feelings of physical restlessness. Attentional problems may be more commonly observed beginning in later childhood, especially in school and in adults in occupational settings.</li><li>The manifestations and severity of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder often vary according to the characteristics and demands of the environment. Symptoms and behaviours should be evaluated across multiple types of environments as a part of clinical assessment.</li><li>Where available, teacher and parent reports should be obtained to establish the diagnosis in children and adolescents. In adults, the report of a significant other, family member, or co-worker can provide important additional information.</li><li>Some individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder may first present for services in adulthood. When making the diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in adults, a history of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity before age 12 is an important corroborating feature that can be best established from school or local records, or from informants who knew the individual during childhood. In the absence of such corroborating information, a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in older adolescents and adults should be made with caution.</li><li>In a subset of individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, especially in children, an exclusively inattentive presentation may occur. There is no hyperactivity and the presentation is characterized by daydreaming, mind-wandering, and a lack of focus. These children are sometimes referred to as exhibiting a restrictive inattentive pattern of symptoms or sluggish cognitive tempo.</li><li>In a subset of individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, combined presentation, severe inattentiveness and hyperactivity-impulsivity are both consistently present in most of the situations that an individual encounters, and are also evidenced by the clinician’s own observations. This pattern is often referred to as hyperkinetic disorder and is considered a more severe form of the disorder.</li><li>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder symptoms often significantly limit academic achievement. Adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder often find it difficult to hold down a demanding job and may be disproportionately underemployed or unemployed. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder can also strain interpersonal relationships across the life span including those with family members, peers, and romantic partners. Individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder often have greater difficulty regulating their behaviour in the context of groups than in one-on-one situations.</li><li>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder often co-occurs with other Neurodevelopmental Disorders, including Developmental Speech or Language Disorders, and Primary Tics or Tic Disorders, which are classified in the Chapter on Diseases of the Nervous System but cross-listed under Neurodevelopment Disorders. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is associated with an increased risk of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and with elevated rates of epilepsy. Emotional dysregulation, low frustration tolerance, and subtle clumsiness and other minor (‘soft’) neurological abnormalities in sensory and motor performance in the absence of any identifiable brain pathology are also common in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.</li><li>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is associated with an increased risk for physical health problems including accidents.</li><li>Acute onset of hyperactive behaviour in a school-age child or adolescent should raise the possibility that symptoms are better accounted for by another mental disorder or by a medical condition. For example, abrupt onset of hyperactivity in adolescence or adulthood may indicate an emergent Primary Psychotic or Bipolar Disorder.</li><li>Although Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder tends to run in families with evidence of high heritability, the predominant symptom pattern in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in a given individual often changes over time and cannot be predicted based on the predominant symptoms of other family members.</li></ul><h3 id="boundary-with-normality-threshold">Boundary with Normality (Threshold):</h3><ul><li>Inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms are present in many children, adolescents and adults, especially during certain developmental periods (e.g., early childhood). The diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder requires that these symptoms be persistent across time, pervasive across situations, significantly out of keeping with developmental level, and have a direct negative impact on academic, occupational, or social functioning.</li></ul><h3 id="course-features">Course Features:</h3><ul><li>Nearly half of all children diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder will continue to exhibit symptoms into adolescence. Predictors of persistence into adolescence and adulthood include: co-occurring childhood onset Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders, lower intellectual functioning, poorer social functioning, and behavioural problems.</li><li>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder symptoms tend to remain stable throughout adolescence with approximately one third of individuals diagnosed in childhood continuing to experience impairment in adulthood.</li><li>Although symptoms of hyperactivity become less overt during adolescence and adulthood, individuals may still experience difficulties with inattention, impulsivity, and restlessness.</li></ul><h3 id="developmental-presentations">Developmental Presentations:</h3><ul><li>Adolescents and adults may only seek clinical services after age 12 once symptoms become more limiting with increasing social, emotional, and academic demands or in the context of an evolving co-occurring Mental, Behavioural, or Neurodevelopmental Disorders that results in an exacerbation of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder symptoms.</li></ul><h3 id="culture-related-features">Culture-Related Features:</h3><ul><li>The symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder consistently fall into two separate dimensions across cultures: inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. However, culture can influence acceptability of symptoms as well as how caregivers respond to them.</li><li>The assessment of hyperactivity should take into account cultural norms of age and gender-appropriate behaviour. For example, in some countries hyperactive behaviour may be seen as a sign of strength in a boy (e.g., ‘boiling blood’) while being perceived very negatively in a girl.</li><li>Symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity may occur in response to exposure to traumatic events and grief reactions during childhood particularly in highly vulnerable and disadvantaged populations, including in post-conflict areas. In these settings, clinicians should consider whether the diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is warranted.</li></ul><h3 id="sex--andor-gender-related-features">Sex- and/or Gender-Related Features:</h3><ul><li>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is more common in males.</li><li>Females are more likely to exhibit inattentive symptoms whereas males are more likely to exhibit symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity particularly at younger ages.</li></ul>]]></content><author><name>World Health Organisation (WHO)</name></author><category term="ADHD," /><category term="Diagnostic," /><category term="Reference" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ICD-11 entry for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/assets/img/insights/2018/icd11_6a05_adhd.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="/assets/img/insights/2018/icd11_6a05_adhd.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</title><link href="/insights/icd11_6a02_asd.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)" /><published>2018-06-18T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2025-10-30T20:09:55+11:00</updated><id>/insights/asd</id><content type="html" xml:base="/insights/icd11_6a02_asd.html"><![CDATA[<blockquote class="sidenote"><p><strong>Caution:</strong><em>The following text is extracted from the ICD-11 definition of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

A qualifier is also provided for loss of previously acquired skills, which is a feature of the developmental history of a small proportion of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder.</p><h4 id="co-occurring-disorder-of-intellectual-development">Co-occurring Disorder of Intellectual Development</h4><p>Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder may exhibit limitations in intellectual abilities. If present, a separate diagnosis of Disorder of Intellectual Development should be assigned, using the appropriate category to designate severity (i.e., Mild, Moderate, Severe, Profound, Provisional). Because social deficits are a core feature of Autism Spectrum Disorder, the assessment of adaptive behaviour as a part of the diagnosis of a co-occurring Disorder of Intellectual Development should place greater emphasis on the intellectual, conceptual, and practical domains of adaptive functioning than on social skills.</p><p>If no co-occurring diagnosis of Disorder of Intellectual Development is present, the following qualifier for the Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis should be applied:</p><ul><li>without Disorder of Intellectual Development</li></ul><p>If there is a co-occurring diagnosis of Disorder of Intellectual Development, the following qualifier for the Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis should be applied, in addition to the appropriate diagnostic code for the co-occurring Disorder of Intellectual Development:</p><ul><li>with Disorder of Intellectual Development</li></ul><h4 id="degree-of-functional-language-impairment">Degree of Functional Language Impairment</h4><p>The degree of impairment in functional language (spoken or signed) should be designated with a second qualifier. Functional language refers to the capacity of the individual to use language for instrumental purposes (e.g., to express personal needs and desires). This qualifier is intended to reflect primarily the verbal and non-verbal expressive language deficits present in some individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder and not the pragmatic language deficits that are a core feature of Autism Spectrum Disorder.</p><p>The following qualifier should be applied to indicate the extent of functional language impairment (spoken or signed) relative to the individual’s age:</p><ul><li>with mild or no impairment of functional language</li><li>with impaired functional language (i.e., not able to use more than single words or simple phrases)</li><li>with complete, or almost complete, absence of functional language</li></ul><h5 id="table-65-diagnostic-codes-for-autism-spectrum-disorder">Table 6.5 Diagnostic Codes for Autism Spectrum Disorder</h5><table><thead><tr><th></th><th style="text-align: center">with mild or no impairment of functional language</th><th style="text-align: center">with impaired functional language</th><th style="text-align: center">with complete, or almost complete, absence of functional language</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>without Disorder of Intellectual Development</td><td style="text-align: center"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">6A02.0</code></td><td style="text-align: center"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">6A02.2</code></td><td style="text-align: center"><em>-</em></td></tr><tr><td>with Disorder of Intellectual Development</td><td style="text-align: center"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">6A02.1</code></td><td style="text-align: center"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">6A02.3</code></td><td style="text-align: center"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">6A02.5</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br />

This regression typically occurs during the second year of life and most often involves language use and social responsiveness. Loss of previously acquired skills is rarely observed after 3 years of age. If it occurs after age 3, it is more likely to involve loss of cognitive and adaptive skills (e.g., loss of bowel and bladder control, impaired sleep), regression of language and social abilities, as well as increasing emotional and behavioural disturbances.</p><p>There are two alternative specifiers, to denote whether or not loss of previously acquired skills is an aspect of the clinical history, where x corresponds to the final digit shown in Table 6.5:</p><h3 id="additional-clinical-features">Additional Clinical Features:</h3><ul><li>Common symptom presentations of Autism Spectrum Disorder in young children are parental or caregiver concerns about intellectual or other developmental delays (e.g., problems in language and motor coordination). When there is no significant impairment of intellectual functioning, clinical services may only be sought later (e.g., due to behaviour or social problems when starting school). In middle childhood, there may be prominent symptoms of anxiety, including Social Anxiety Disorder, school refusal, and Specific Phobia. During adolescence and adulthood, Depressive Disorders are often a presenting feature.</li><li>Co-occurrence of Autism Spectrum Disorder with other Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders is common across the lifespan. In a substantial proportion of cases, particularly in adolescence and adulthood, it is a co-occurring disorder that first brings an individual with Autism Spectrum Disorder to clinical attention.</li><li>Pragmatic language difficulties may manifest as an overly literal understanding of others’ speech, speech that lacks normal prosody and emotional tone and therefore appears monotonous, lack of awareness of the appropriateness of their choice of language in particular social contexts, or pedantic precision in the use of language.</li><li>Social naiveté, especially during adolescence, can lead to exploitation by others, a risk that may be enhanced by the use of social media without adequate supervision.</li><li>Profiles of specific cognitive skills in Autism Spectrum Disorder as measured by standardized assessments may show striking and unusual patterns of strengths and weaknesses that are highly variable from individual to individual. These deficits can affect learning and adaptive functioning to a greater extent than would be predicted from the overall scores on measures of verbal and non-verbal intelligence.</li><li>Self-injurious behaviours (e.g., hitting one’s face, head banging) occur more often in individuals with co-occurring Disorder of Intellectual Development.</li><li>Some young individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder, especially those with a co-occurring Disorder of Intellectual Development, develop epilepsy or seizures during early childhood with a second increase in prevalence during adolescence. Catatonic states have also been described. A number of medical disorders such as Tuberous Sclerosis, chromosomal abnormalities including Fragile X Syndrome, Cerebral Palsy, early onset epileptic encephalopathies, and Neurofibromatosis are associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder with or without a co-occurring Disorder of Intellectual Development. Genomic deletions, duplications and other genetic abnormalities are increasingly described in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder, some of which may be important for genetic counselling. Prenatal exposure to valproate is also associated with an increased risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder.</li><li>Some individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder are capable of functioning adequately by making an exceptional effort to compensate for their symptoms during childhood, adolescence or adulthood. Such sustained effort, which may be more typical of affected females, can have a deleterious impact on mental health and well-being.</li></ul><h3 id="boundary-with-normality-threshold">Boundary with Normality (Threshold):</h3><ul><li><strong>Social interaction skills:</strong> Typically developing individuals vary in the pace and extent to which they acquire and master skills of reciprocal social interaction and social communication. A diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder should only be considered if there is marked and persistent deviation from the expected range of abilities and behaviours in these domains given the individual’s age, level of intellectual functioning, and sociocultural context. Some individuals may exhibit limited social interaction due to shyness (i.e., feelings of awkwardness or fear in new situations or with unfamiliar people) or behavioural inhibition (i.e., being slow to approach or to ‘warm up’ to new people and situations). Limited social interactions in shy or behaviourally inhibited children, adolescents, or adults are not indicative of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Shyness is differentiated from Autism Spectrum Disorder by evidence of adequate social communication behaviours in familiar situations.</li><li><strong>Social communication skills:</strong> Children vary widely in the age at which they first acquire spoken language and the pace at which their speech and language become firmly established. Most children with early language delay eventually acquire similar language skills as their same-age peers. Early language delay alone is not strongly indicative of Autism Spectrum Disorder unless there is also evidence of limited motivation for social communication and limited interaction skills. An essential feature of Autism Spectrum Disorder is persistent impairment in the ability to understand and use language appropriately for social communication.</li><li><strong>Repetitive and stereotyped behaviours:</strong> Many children go through phases of repetitive play and highly focused interests as a part of typical development. Unless there is also evidence of impaired reciprocal social interaction and social communication, patterns of behaviour characterized by repetition, routine, or restricted interests are not by themselves indicative of Autism Spectrum Disorder.</li></ul><h3 id="course-features">Course Features:</h3><ul><li>Although Autism Spectrum Disorder can present clinically at all ages, including during adulthood, it is a lifelong disorder the manifestations and impact of which are likely to vary according to age, intellectual and language abilities, co-occurring conditions and environmental context.</li><li>Restricted and repetitive behaviours persist over time. Specifically, repetitive sensorimotor behaviours appear to be common, consistent, and potentially severe. During the school age years and adolescence, these repetitive sensorimotor behaviours begin to lessen in intensity and number. Insistence on sameness, which is less prevalent, appears to develop during preschool and worsen over time.</li></ul><h3 id="developmental-presentations">Developmental Presentations:</h3><ul><li><em>Infancy:</em> Characteristic features may emerge during infancy although they may only be recognized as indicative of Autism Spectrum Disorder in retrospect. It is usually possible to make the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder during the preschool period (up to 4 years), especially in children exhibiting generalized developmental delay. Plateauing of social communication and language skills and failure to progress in their development is not uncommon. The loss of early words and social responsiveness, i.e., a true regression, with an onset between 1 and 2 years, is unusual but significant and rarely occurs after the third year of life. In these cases, the qualifier ‘with loss of previously acquired skills’ should be applied.</li><li><em>Preschool:</em> In preschool children, indicators of an Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis often include avoidance of mutual eye contact, resistance to physical affection, a lack of social imaginary play, language that is delayed in onset or is precocious but not used for social conversation; social withdrawal, obsessive or repetitive preoccupations, and a lack of social interaction with peers characterized by parallel play or disinterest. Sensory sensitivities to everyday sounds, or to foods, may overshadow the underlying social communication deficits.</li><li><em>Middle Childhood:</em> In children with Autism Spectrum Disorder without a Disorder of Intellectual Development, social adjustment difficulties outside the home may not be detected until school entry or adolescence when social communication problems lead to social isolation from peers. Resistance to engage in unfamiliar experiences and marked reactions to even minor change in routines are typical. Furthermore, excessive focus on detail as well as rigidity of behaviour and thinking may be significant. Symptoms of anxiety may become evident at this stage of development.</li><li><em>Adolescence:</em> By adolescence, the capacity to cope with increasing social complexity in peer relationships at a time of increasingly demanding academic expectations is often overwhelmed. In some individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder, the underlying social communication deficits may be overshadowed by the symptoms of co-occurring Mental and Behavioural Disorders. Depressive symptoms are often a presenting feature</li><li><em>Adulthood:</em> In adulthood, the capacity for those with Autism Spectrum Disorder to cope with social relationships can become increasingly challenged, and clinical presentation may occur when social demands overwhelm the capacity to compensate. Presenting problems in adulthood may represent reactions to social isolation or the social consequences of inappropriate behaviour. Compensation strategies may be sufficient to sustain dyadic relationships, but are usually inadequate in social groups. Special interests, and focused attention, may benefit some individuals in education and employment. Work environments may have to be tailored to the capacities of the individual. A first diagnosis in adulthood may be precipitated by a breakdown in domestic or work relationships. In Autism Spectrum Disorder there is always a history of early childhood social communication and relationship difficulties, although this may only be apparent in retrospect.</li></ul><h3 id="culture-related-features">Culture-Related Features:</h3><ul><li>Cultural variation exists in norms of social communication, reciprocal social interactions, as well as interests and activities. Therefore, signs of impairment in functioning may differ depending on cultural context. For example, in some societies it may be normative for children may avoid direct eye contact out of deference, which should not be misinterpreted as impairment in social interaction.</li></ul><h3 id="sex--andor-gender-related-features">Sex- and/or Gender-Related Features:</h3><ul><li>Males are four times more likely than females to be diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder.</li><li>Females diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder are more frequently diagnosed with co-occurring Disorders of Intellectual Development, suggesting that less severe presentations may go undetected as compared to males. Females tend to demonstrate fewer restricted, repetitive interests and behaviours than males.</li><li>During middle-childhood, gender differences in presentation differentially affect functioning. Boys may act out with reactive aggression or other behavioural symptoms when challenged or frustrated. Girls tend to withdraw socially, and react with emotional changes to their social adjustment difficulties.</li></ul>]]></content><author><name>World Health Organisation (WHO)</name></author><category term="Autism," /><category term="ASD," /><category term="Diagnostic," /><category term="Reference" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ICD-11 entry for Autism Spectrum Disorder.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/assets/img/insights/2018/icd11_6a02_asd.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="/assets/img/insights/2018/icd11_6a02_asd.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Don’t Mourn for Us</title><link href="/insights/jim_sinclair_dont_mourn_for_us.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Don’t Mourn for Us" /><published>1993-03-01T00:00:00+11:00</published><updated>2025-10-12T16:46:00+11:00</updated><id>/insights/dont-mourn-for-us</id><content type="html" xml:base="/insights/jim_sinclair_dont_mourn_for_us.html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="dont-mourn-for-us">Don’t Mourn for Us</h1><p><strong>by Jim Sinclair</strong><br /><em>Extracted from <a href="https://www.autreat.com/dont_mourn.html">https://www.autreat.com/dont_mourn.html</a></em>.</p><blockquote><p><em>[This article was published in the Autism Network International newsletter, Our Voice, Volume 1, Number 3, 1993. It is an outline of the presentation Jim gave at the 1993 International Conference on Autism in Toronto, and is addressed primarily to parents.]</em></p></blockquote><p>Parents often report that learning their child is autistic was the most traumatic thing that ever happened to them. Non-autistic people see autism as a great tragedy, and parents experience continuing disappointment and grief at all stages of the child’s and family’s life cycle.
But this grief does not stem from the child’s autism in itself. It is grief over the loss of the normal child the parents had hoped and expected to have. Parents’ attitudes and expectations, and the discrepancies between what parents expect of children at a particular age and their own child’s actual development, cause more stress and anguish than the practical complexities of life with an autistic person.</p><p>Some amount of grief is natural as parents adjust to the fact that an event and a relationship they’ve been looking forward to isn’t going to materialize. But this grief over a fantasized normal child needs to be separated from the parents’ perceptions of the child they do have: the autistic child who needs the support of adult caretakers and who can form very meaningful relationships with those caretakers if given the opportunity. Continuing focus on the child’s autism as a source of grief is damaging for both the parents and the child, and precludes the development of an accepting and authentic relationship between them. For their own sake and for the sake of their children, I urge parents to make radical changes in their perceptions of what autism means.</p><p>I invite you to look at our autism, and look at your grief, from our perspective:</p><h5 id="autism-is-not-an-appendage">Autism is not an appendage</h5><p>Autism isn’t something a person has, or a “shell” that a person is trapped inside. There’s no normal child hidden behind the autism. Autism is a way of being. It is pervasive; it colors every experience, every sensation, perception, thought, emotion, and encounter, every aspect of existence. It is not possible to separate the autism from the person–and if it were possible, the person you’d have left would not be the same person you started with.</p><p>This is important, so take a moment to consider it: Autism is a way of being. It is not possible to separate the person from the autism.</p><p>Therefore, when parents say,</p><blockquote><p>I wish my child did not have autism,</p></blockquote><p>what they’re really saying is,</p><blockquote><p>I wish the autistic child I have did not exist, and I had a different (non-autistic) child instead.</p></blockquote><p>Read that again. This is what we hear when you mourn over our existence. This is what we hear when you pray for a cure. This is what we know, when you tell us of your fondest hopes and dreams for us: that your greatest wish is that one day we will cease to be, and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces.</p><h5 id="autism-is-not-an-impenetrable-wall">Autism is not an impenetrable wall</h5><p>You try to relate to your autistic child, and the child doesn’t respond. He doesn’t see you; you can’t reach her; there’s no getting through. That’s the hardest thing to deal with, isn’t it? The only thing is, it isn’t true.</p><p>Look at it again: You try to relate as parent to child, using your own understanding of normal children, your own feelings about parenthood, your own experiences and intuitions about relationships. And the child doesn’t respond in any way you can recognize as being part of that system.</p><p>That does not mean the child is incapable of relating at all. It only means you’re assuming a shared system, a shared understanding of signals and meanings, that the child in fact does not share. It’s as if you tried to have an intimate conversation with someone who has no comprehension of your language. Of course the person won’t understand what you’re talking about, won’t respond in the way you expect, and may well find the whole interaction confusing and unpleasant.</p><p>It takes more work to communicate with someone whose native language isn’t the same as yours. And autism goes deeper than language and culture; autistic people are “foreigners” in any society. You’re going to have to give up your assumptions about shared meanings. You’re going to have to learn to back up to levels more basic than you’ve probably thought about before, to translate, and to check to make sure your translations are understood. You’re going to have to give up the certainty that comes of being on your own familiar territory, of knowing you’re in charge, and let your child teach you a little of her language, guide you a little way into his world.</p><p>And the outcome, if you succeed, still will not be a normal parent-child relationship. Your autistic child may learn to talk, may attend regular classes in school, may go to college, drive a car, live independently, have a career–but will never relate to you as other children relate to their parents. Or your autistic child may never speak, may graduate from a self-contained special education classroom to a sheltered activity program or a residential facility, may need lifelong full-time care and supervision–but is not completely beyond your reach. The ways we relate are different. Push for the things your expectations tell you are normal, and you’ll find frustration, disappointment, resentment, maybe even rage and hatred. Approach respectfully, without preconceptions, and with openness to learning new things, and you’ll find a world you could never have imagined.</p><p>Yes, that takes more work than relating to a non-autistic person. But it can be done–unless non-autistic people are far more limited than we are in their capacity to relate. We spend our entire lives doing it. Each of us who does learn to talk to you, each of us who manages to function at all in your society, each of us who manages to reach out and make a connection with you, is operating in alien territory, making contact with alien beings. We spend our entire lives doing this. And then you tell us that we can’t relate.</p><h5 id="autism-is-not-death">Autism is not death</h5><p>Granted, autism isn’t what most parents expect or look forward to when they anticipate the arrival of a child. What they expect is a child who will be like them, who will share their world and relate to them without requiring intensive on-the-job training in alien contact. Even if their child has some disability other than autism, parents expect to be able to relate to that child on the terms that seem normal to them; and in most cases, even allowing for the limitations of various disabilities, it is possible to form the kind of bond the parents had been looking forward to.</p><p>But not when the child is autistic. Much of the grieving parents do is over the non-occurrence of the expected relationship with an expected normal child. This grief is very real, and it needs to be expected and worked through so people can get on with their lives–</p><p>but it has nothing to do with autism.</p><p>What it comes down to is that you expected something that was tremendously important to you, and you looked forward to it with great joy and excitement, and maybe for a while you thought you actually had it–and then, perhaps gradually, perhaps abruptly, you had to recognize that the thing you looked forward to hasn’t happened. It isn’t going to happen. No matter how many other, normal children you have, nothing will change the fact that this time, the child you waited and hoped and planned and dreamed for didn’t arrive.</p><p>This is the same thing that parents experience when a child is stillborn, or when they have their baby to hold for a short time, only to have it die in infancy. It isn’t about autism, it’s about shattered expectations. I suggest that the best place to address these issues is not in organizations devoted to autism, but in parental bereavement counseling and support groups. In those settings parents learn to come to terms with their loss–not to forget about it, but to let it be in the past, where the grief doesn’t hit them in the face every waking moment of their lives. They learn to accept that their child is gone, forever, and won’t be coming back. Most importantly, they learn not to take out their grief for the lost child on their surviving children. This is of critical importance when one of those surviving children arrived at t time the child being mourned for died.</p><p>You didn’t lose a child to autism. You lost a child because the child you waited for never came into existence. That isn’t the fault of the autistic child who does exist, and it shouldn’t be our burden. We need and deserve families who can see us and value us for ourselves, not families whose vision of us is obscured by the ghosts of children who never lived. Grieve if you must, for your own lost dreams. But don’t mourn for us. We are alive. We are real. And we’re here waiting for you.</p><p>This is what I think autism societies should be about: not mourning for what never was, but exploration of what is. We need you. We need your help and your understanding. Your world is not very open to us, and we won’t make it without your strong support. Yes, there is tragedy that comes with autism: not because of what we are, but because of the things that happen to us. Be sad about that, if you want to be sad about something. Better than being sad about it, though, get mad about it–and then do something about it. The tragedy is not that we’re here, but that your world has no place for us to be. How can it be otherwise, as long as our own parents are still grieving over having brought us into the world?</p><p>Take a look at your autistic child sometime, and take a moment to tell yourself who that child is not. Think to yourself: “This is not my child that I expected and planned for. This is not the child I waited for through all those months of pregnancy and all those hours of labor. This is not the child I made all those plans to share all those experiences with. That child never came. This is not that child.” Then go do whatever grieving you have to do–away from the autistic child–and start learning to let go.</p><p>After you’ve started that letting go, come back and look at your autistic child again, and say to yourself: “This is not my child that I expected and planned for. This is an alien child who landed in my life by accident. I don’t know who this child is or what it will become. But I know it’s a child, stranded in an alien world, without parents of its own kind to care for it. It needs someone to care for it, to teach it, to interpret and to advocate for it. And because this alien child happened to drop into my life, that job is mine if I want it.”</p><p>If that prospect excites you, then come join us, in strength and determination, in hope and in joy. The adventure of a lifetime is ahead of you.</p><p><em>– Jim Sinclair.</em></p>]]></content><author><name>Jim Sinclair</name></author><category term="Autism," /><category term="ASD" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are frequently asked why we decided to support neurodiversity.
